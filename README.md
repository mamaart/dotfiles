# 📜 My dotfile

Everything is almost nice, I just need to figure out a few things:

- [ ] change gtk theme to dracula
- [ ] add some visuals for volume up and down 
- [ ] p10K is making zhs start way too slowly
- [ ] Add custom fonts (MesloLGS NF)
- [ ] Add dwm scripts for dmenu (from .local/bin)
- [ ] set keyboard mappings for volume and brightness
- [ ] privatekeys on usb.. or?
- [ ] rsync automated backup

## 🚀 Some nice featues

### 🎨 Window manager
DWM with dmenu

### ✍️ NixVim

### 🐚 Zsh with extra power

### 🎵 A systemd service for radio with mplayer
