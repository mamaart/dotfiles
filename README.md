# My NixOS configuration

Everything is almost nice, I just need to figure out a few things:

- [ ] change gtk theme to dracula
- [ ] add some visuals for volume up and down 
- [ ] p10K is making zhs start way too slowly
- [ ] Add custom fonts (MesloLGS NF)
- [ ] Add dwm scripts for dmenu (from .local/bin)
- [ ] set keyboard mappings for volume and brightness
- [ ] privatekeys on usb.. or?
- [ ] rsync automated backup

## Some nice featues

### Window manager
DWM with dmenu

### NixVim

### Zsh with extra power

### A systemd service for radio with mplayer
